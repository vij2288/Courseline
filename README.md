Courseline
==========

Project - Courseline - Android app to manage course milestones better.

This project was conceptualised and developed to solve actual problem of students in a university. Whenever students register for courses in a semester, they have to go to individual course websites to track the deadlines and submissions. We think that this is a hassle and thus came up with this Adnroid application built for a Android Nexus 7 Tablet. 

This App brings all the data of the courses to a single screen and gives an intuitive interface to explore the data. We have used XML document as the source of the information and have used Dropbox Public folder as the server for this project.

This project was developed my two people, Myself (Vijith Venkatesh) and Sagar Medikeri during one of the semesters in our graduate studies.
